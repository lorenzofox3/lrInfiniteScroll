# lrInfiniteScroll

It is a module for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) which allow you to attach an event handler to the element when this element
has been scrolled almost to its bottom or top (or both). In most of the case it will be used for infinite scrolling.
It is very light (about 70 lines of code) and optimized to reduce the amount of $digest loop.

See the [example section](http://lorenzofox3.github.io/lrInfiniteScroll/index.html#example)

## Attach an event handler

simply set as attribute a function accessible within the $scope

```html
<ul lr-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```

## Set inverse scroll direction

Set if scrolling from bottom to top so the event handler will be called when scrolled almost to the top.

```html
<ul lr-infinite-scroll-inverse="myEventHandler">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```

## Change the scroll threshold

By default the handler will be called when the user is scrolling *down* and only *50* pixels are remaining before reaching the end
of the element. You can overwrite the 50px by setting the attribute *scroll-threshold*

```html
<ul lr-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler" scroll-threshold="200">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```
## Change the time threshold

To reduce the amount of $digest loop, instead of calling the handler whenever a scroll down event is detected in the end zone. A time is started and if
no other event is detected within 400ms, then the handler is called. You can overwrite the time value by setting the *time-threshold* attribute.

```html
<ul lr-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler" scroll-threshold="200" time-threshold="600">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```
